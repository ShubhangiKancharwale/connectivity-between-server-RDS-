Steps 
-	Deploy linux server(ubuntu) which is deployed in public subnet.
-	After launching instance, go to the RDS service and create data base.
-	While creating database select MariaDB engine type and make sure that DB instance identifier must be unique keep "password" same as identifier.
-	Public access is denied keep it off. 
-	Firstly paste the private IP of server in RDS security gr with port 3306.
-	Then login to linux server update all.
       apt update all
       apt update
-	For database connectivity install MariaDB-client , MySQL-client check the latest version of MySQL.
      apt-get install mariadb-client
      apt install mysql-client-core
-	When you create RDS database that will generate one endpoint.
-	Run this command :  mysql -h endpoint -P 3306 -u admin -p  replace the endpoint with DB endpoint. 
- It will ask you for "password" provide that now able to access the mysql.
-	Try to create database here I created one database and puts some info in that database.
    For ex  
          show database;      (this query shows you the default tables present in database)
          create database students;
          use students;
          create table stud_info(name varchar(30), role number varchar(30), branch varchar(20));
          show table;
          insert into stud_info values("jatin", 1, 97573538);
          select*from stud_info;
